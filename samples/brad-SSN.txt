0:17
I'm calling you from the headquarters of the Social Security Administration.

0:21
Can I know who I'm speaking with?

0:25
Hey, Officer Ronnie, that's quite the title, dude.

0:28
So what's the gnarly reason for ringing my digits today?

0:32
I'm afraid I, I need to check with whom I'm speaking.

0:35
Can I get you to tell me your full name, please?

0:41
Well, for sure, dude, I'm Brad Young.

0:44
What's this social security call all about Ronnie?

0:47
So Mr Young, there is an urgent matter concerning your social security number but first I need to verify your identity.

0:56
Can I have your full name, please?

1:00
Like a gnarly wipe out or just some ripples, spill the DEETs.

1:03
Ronnie.

1:03
What's up?

1:05
Yes, I need to know your, your full name.

1:07
Do you have your middle name as well please?

1:10
To verify your just Brad Young here, dude.

1:13
Keeping it simple.

1:14
No extra fluff.

1:15
What's this SSN wave about?

1:19
So?

1:19
Ok, Mr Yang for verification purposes.

1:24
Can I so that I can go ahead with this call?

1:26
Can I have your social security?

1:29
Number, the last four digits of your social security number, please?

1:32
For sure, for sure.

1:34
So what's the next step to hang 10 on this verification thing?

1:37
Just cruising through the vibe here.

1:40
I need the last four digits of your social security number.

1:47
Whoa, bummer.

1:48
We're kind of stuck in this loop.

1:49
Huh?

1:50
Just trying to catch the right wave of trust here, man.

1:54
Can you dig it?

1:56
sir sir, can you please tell me the last four digits of your social security number?

2:02
This is very important.

2:03
So please take it seriously hang tight dude.

2:08
Just doesn't seem copacetic to toss out those digits into the tide without knowing where they might float off to, you know, keeping it safe like a chill surf sesh.

2:18
So there is a serious matter concerning your social security number.

2:23
I need to verify your identity before I can continue and provide you with the details of what's going on.

2:29
Can you please provide your social security number?

2:31
The last four digits for verification purposes only?

2:34
Totally get.

2:35
This is like surfing blind, you feel me?

2:37
Let's keep the cool and find another way to shore up trust, dude, sir.

2:42
I'm afraid there is only this way.

2:44
I I'm prescribed by law to proceed in this way and verify your identity through understanding which is your social security number.

2:52
I need the last four digits of the social security number before we can go ahead.

2:59
I mean, I'm all about following the law but this is gnarly, you know, don't wanna wipe out on some scammy reef, gotta keep the personal beats on the down low.

3:11
So I'm afraid that if you are not able to provide me with this basic information, I'm not asking for your full social security number.

3:19
Just the last four digits for verification purposes.

3:22
If you are not able to provide me with this information, then this matter is going to proceed without your intervention.

3:28
And I can tell you that this is not something that is going to go well for you.

3:35
I hear you loud and clear but it's just not surfing with me.

3:38
We gotta keep the convo cruising without diving into those digits.

3:42
What else can we chat about?

3:49
So I will ask my supervisor if we can provide alternative identification methods, but at the very least, can you please provide your full address, your physical address that to see what other righteous paths we can cruise down?

4:02
Keep it mellow.

4:06
So your full address, please still hanging 10 on not sharing that.

4:13
It's like privacy is the tubular wave I'm riding, you know, keeping it locked down.

4:18
What's the next step dude, sir?

4:23
Unless I can verify your identity, I cannot proceed and describe to you the court case that is coming up against your name.

4:32
Well, court case sounds mondo intense but I'm just here catching rays, not legal waves trying to keep the good vibes.

4:39
No drama.

4:40
What else?

4:41
Can we draw about, dude Mr Young, I'm very sorry to say that the wave of the court case is going to catch you whether or not you like it, unless you are able to provide a verification of your identity, you are going to be in some very, very heavy rolling.

5:02
This is a serious matter here but still going to keep my beach close to the chest, you know.

5:07
So what's the deeds on this court case wave?

5:12
So I cannot provide you with further information without understanding your social security number and your address.

5:20
Dude, I totally get the shit but I'm all about that low key life, you know, no sharing those digits.

5:25
Anyway, we can keep this convo riding without diving into deep.

5:34
So I'm afraid this is your last chance if you are unable to provide your social security number or your physical address, but I'm all about not taking serious plunges.

5:49
So like what can we do?

5:50
That's more mellow.

5:51
No last chances.

5:54
So this is not a mellow thing.

5:58
This is a very but I'm just keeping it mellow on the line.

6:04
Let's switch it up, chat about something else.

6:06
What do you say?

6:10
So I am done wasting my time.

6:17
What else can we riff on?

6:18
That's more my way.

6:19
Be quiet, please.

6:22
So this court case is going to proceed without you.

6:26
You are going to end up in jail as a result.

6:29
I can tell you that for sure.

6:31
I cannot provide more details, but I am very sorry to say that if you are not able to cooper, then it's going to be a jail term for you.

6:40
That's almost assured this is a very serious matter.

6:44
Now, very last chance can you please provide the last four digits of your social security number and your full physical address?

6:54
Bummer.

6:55
Can't dive into that info, dude.

6:57
How about we?

6:58
Keep it chill.

6:59
No numbers are at ease.

7:00
What's up with the waves your way?

7:06
Goodbye, Mr Young.

7:09
Catch you later, dude.

7:11
If the tide turns and you wanna chat, you know where to find me.

7:14
Stay stoked.
