Hello, this is Jordan from Walmart customer service.

0:05
I'm calling to let you know that you've been selected for a $100 Walmart gift card.

0:12
Oh, hello, Jordan.

0:13
How are you doing today?

0:14
What's this about?

0:17
It's a $100 gift card which you can use at any store you want to.

0:21
That includes Walmart, Walgreens Home Depot, Best Buy Target.

0:26
You don't have to pay your bills, do some online shopping and if you want to go to any restaurant, you can do that too.

0:31
The card is valid for one year.

0:33
, are you interested in this gift card?

0:36
Oh, that sounds lovely.

0:38
Jordan.

0:38
How do I go about getting this gift card?

0:40
Then?

0:42
I'll handle that for you.

0:43
All I need to know is your name so that we can print your name on the gift card and no one else can use it and then it probably be shipped to you by U SPS regular mail.

0:54
My name is Edna Fisher.

0:55
What else do you need from me?

0:56
, so it takes two business days for you to, for the shipping to process.

1:05
, there is a one time shipping and activation fee of $5.95.

1:13
Is this ok?

1:14
Two days, is it?

1:15
That's pretty quick.

1:16
What should I be doing in the meantime?

1:18
, you can do whatever you like, sir.

1:23
, and once you get the gift card, you can send it wherever you want to.

1:26
, so can you just repeat your name for me, please?

1:32
I'm Edna.

1:32
Love not a sir.

1:33
And the handling fee, how do I pay that one?

1:40
I'll write your name down.

1:41
Is that Edna E DNA?

1:47
Yes, Jordan.

1:48
Edna with an E and it's Fisher with ach, not like the fish in the sea.

1:56
Ok.

1:56
For the one time shipping and activation fee, I will need to get your credit card or debit card.

2:03
Do you have a Visa or a mastercard?

2:09
Oh, Jordan, how safe is that putting card details over the phone?

2:12
You know, perfectly fine.

2:18
Once you pay the $5.95 shipping and activation fee, we'll get you your $100.

2:25
Ok, Jordan, tell me more about this fee.

2:27
How does it work?

2:30
So this fee covers the shipping and the activation.

2:33
Once you pay this, you'll have the gift card and you can use it wherever you want to.

2:39
Right?

2:40
Oh, Jordan.

2:40
But if I've got no card, how else can I sort it?

2:47
Do you have a card in your wallet, sir?

2:51
Yes.

2:51
Got a card.

2:52
But really, how safe is it to give you the number over this?

2:54
Call.

2:57
It's ok.

2:58
This is a secure channel.

3:00
What's your number on the front of the card?

3:02
Secure channel?

3:03
That's a relief.

3:04
Still, I've never done this before.

3:05
Jordan.

3:06
How does it work?

3:11
So, on the front face of the card, can you read out the numbers for me, please?

3:17
Oh, dear.

3:18
I'll just go grab my specs.

3:19
What exactly does the number do for you, Jordan?

3:24
This number lets me charge this $5.95 shipping and activation fee so that you can get your gift card.

3:33
Oh, dear.

3:34
I'm a bit hesitant.

3:35
Isn't there another way to confirm Jordan?
