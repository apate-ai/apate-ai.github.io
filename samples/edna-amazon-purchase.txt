0:13
Yeah, I'm calling about your latest purchase at Amazon shop.

0:18
We recorded that there was a problem with your payment.

0:26
Oh dear a problem with my payment.

0:27
That doesn't sound good at all.

0:29
What seems to be the issue John.

0:31
Yeah, it looks like your credit card was rejected and we actually need you to to redo this payment.

0:42
Yeah, that sounds serious.

0:43
Could you walk me through how to fix it up?

0:45
Love.

0:46
Yes, of course.

0:47
So do you have your credit card handy?

0:53
My credit card you say might be somewhere in my purse.

0:56
Why do you need it again, John.

0:58
Yes.

0:59
So I will tell you how to actually do this payment.

1:03
You can actually do this together with me on the on the time.

1:10
That sounds like a plan.

1:11
Could you please explain how this all works?

1:13
Step by step.

1:15
Yes, it's pretty simple.

1:17
So you will need to just tell me your first name and last name, then credit card and number and and then we can proceed with the payment.

1:30
Oh, Ok.

1:31
Just the name and the numbers then.

1:32
Hm, tell me, is this how it's usually done?

1:35
, no, it's not usually because it is an emergency and just fail scenario that, that we were able to, to find out and now, and now your,, your payment can be fixed.

1:52
Could you say that again?

1:53
Love the line crackled and I missed what you were saying.

1:56
Yes, I was saying that,, we can do this right now quickly over the phone to fix this transaction so that we don't have to bother you via email or other ways to communicate an email you reckon.

2:12
But I'm a bit of a technophobe.

2:14
How does that work again?

2:17
No, no, not the email just you know, you can do it right now via call.

2:24
All right John, but I'm a bit old school calls.

2:27
Fine.

2:27
But could you explain it once more?

2:28
Just so I'm clear.

2:30
Yes.

2:31
So can you take out your your credit card from your address?

2:49
Hello?

2:50
Can you take your credit card?

2:51
Can you find it my credit card?

2:56
Sure.

2:56
Hm.

2:56
Now where did I put my handbag?

2:58
Just a minute, John, I'll need to have a look around.

3:08
No problem.

3:08
Have you found it?

3:11
Let me have a look.

3:12
See it's quite a jungle in here.

3:14
You say your name was John?

3:17
Yes.

3:17
Yes, it's it's yes take your time.

3:22
Ok John give me a sec.

3:23
Will you?

3:24
These old legs aren't as fast as they used to be.

3:28
Yeah.

3:28
No, no problem.

3:32
Oh dear.

3:33
Must be the wrong name.

3:34
How silly of me.

3:35
What did you say your name was again?

3:37
Darling?

3:40
Yeah, John.

3:40
John, you got it right.

3:43
Just a tick.

3:44
Almost got it.

3:45
Now, what will you need first once I have it?

3:49
Yes.

3:50
So I will need the number that is on in the middle of the card.

3:54
It would be like a long number.

3:59
Hold your horses.

4:00
I'm still digging about so many cards here.

4:03
What do these numbers mean again?

4:07
Yeah, so 12 digit card will be the card that is your bank.

4:13
, and this number is, I think eight digit number, 80 digits.

4:20
My eyes aren't what they used to be.

4:22
Got any tips for reading all of those numbers correctly.

4:24
Hun Yeah, they should be very big, big phone number digits.

4:33
That's why I thought it was longer.

4:34
Just let me put on my reading glasses.

4:39
Yep, no problem.

4:43
Did you get it?

4:45
Oh dear.

4:46
I got distracted.

4:46
Just a mo I'm still trying to find those pesky glasses.

4:49
What happens after I read the numbers to you?

4:55
Yes, then, then we can proceed with the payment.

4:57
But first let's,, can you give me this number?

5:02
Of course, love just bear with me.

5:04
I'm a bit muddled which side are the numbers on again and they should be on the front side of the card.

5:14
Front side, got it.

5:15
Let me squint a bit.

5:16
Everything is a blur.

5:17
You wouldn't have any tricks for feeling better, would you love?

5:24
No, they should be actually very well visible on front of your card.

5:30
Now, let's see.

5:31
What's the first number sequence you need?

5:36
There should be four digits.

5:39
So four sets of numbers.

5:41
Is it just a moment?

5:42
I need to find where I put my specs down.

5:44
What should I do after finding the numbers, dear?

5:48
Yeah, just, just read it to me.

5:50
Give me those phone numbers.

5:53
Four numbers, right?

5:54
Oops, slip from my hand.

5:56
Silly me.

5:56
What was that first digit again?

6:05
Yeah, it should be, for example, four or five cracking.

6:08
You'll walk me through it, right?

6:10
For example, what should I be looking for again?

6:15
Yeah, this 54 numbers.

6:18
124345.

6:21
Ok.

6:31
Can you see them?

6:35
I see some numbers.

6:35
Wait oh aunt cat's the cutest mine sitting on the card now.

6:39
What's your pet's name?

6:47
Yeah.

6:48
Can you, can you look at the car and see the number hearing at it now?

6:52
But it's so small.

6:53
What's normally after the first four digits?

6:55
Lovely.

6:59
Yeah, there should be the second part also for numbers.

7:04
Second part too right here.

7:06
Let me gently switch this kitty off.

7:08
So love what happens after the second part.
